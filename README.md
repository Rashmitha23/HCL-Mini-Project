# CROP-YIELD-PREDICTION
Agriculture is the backbone of the Indian economy.  Timely advice to predict the future crop productivity and an analysis is to be made in order to help the farmers to maximize the crop production of crops. In the past farmers used to predict their yield from previous year yield experiences. Now, with the help of those algorithms we can predict crop yield. The objective is to make an accurate crop yield prediction model that helps farmers to decide on what to grow and when to grow.

This project focuses on predicting the yield of the crop by applying various machine learning techniques. The outcome of these techniques is compared on the basis of mean absolute error. The prediction made by machine learning algorithms will help the farmers to decide which crop to grow to get the maximum yield by considering factors like season, rainfall, area, etc.

Machine learning is an important decision support tool for crop yield prediction, including supporting decisions on what crops to grow and what to do during the growing season of the crops. Several machine learning algorithms have been applied to support crop yield prediction research. Machine learning (ML) could be a crucial perspective for acquiring real-world and operative solution for crop yield issue. Considering the present system including manual counting, climate smart pest management and satellite imagery, the result obtained arenâ€™t really accurate. 

The classifier models used here include Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes and Random Forest, out of which the Random Forest provides maximum accuracy. The prediction made by machine learning algorithms will help the farmers to come to a decision which crop to grow to induce the most yield by considering factors like temperature, area, etc. This bridges the gap between technology and agriculture sector.

Software  tools required are Jupyter Notebook,python.

Modules we used in implementing this project-Numpy,pandas,mathplotlib.pyplot,seaborn,sklearn etc![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88217702/236161843-2279cfc2-76dc-4bf7-ba4b-ea69e89e99e3.png)
