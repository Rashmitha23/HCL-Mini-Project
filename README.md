# üåæ Crop Yield Prediction  

Agriculture is a cornerstone of the Indian economy, and predicting crop yield is essential for maximizing productivity and assisting farmers in making informed decisions. This project aims to predict crop yield using machine learning algorithms, helping farmers determine which crops to grow and when, based on various factors such as season, rainfall, and area.

The goal of this project is to create an accurate crop yield prediction model, leveraging machine learning techniques to support decisions on crop selection and farming strategies. The model compares the predictions made by different algorithms, such as **Logistic Regression**, **Naive Bayes**, and **Random Forest**, to determine the best algorithm for this task. The outcome of the analysis helps farmers maximize their yield, considering factors such as weather conditions, soil quality, and agricultural inputs.

## üìä **Evaluation Metrics**

The performance of each machine learning algorithm was evaluated using the **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**. Here are the results:

- **Random Forest**: Achieved the highest accuracy with the lowest MAE, making it the preferred model for predicting crop yield.
- **Logistic Regression**: Provided reasonable predictions but did not perform as well as Random Forest.
- **Naive Bayes**: Showed relatively lower accuracy compared to other algorithms.
